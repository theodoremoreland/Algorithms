// Task
// Complete the code in your editor by writing an overridden getNumberOfTeamMembers method that prints the same statement as the superclass' getNumberOfTeamMembers method, except that it replaces n with 11 (the number of players on a Soccer team).

// Output Format

// When executed, your completed code should print the following:

// Generic Sports
// Each team has n players in Generic Sports
// Soccer Class
// Each team has 11 players in Soccer Class

import java.util.*;

class Sports {

    String getName() {
        return "Generic Sports";
    }

    void getNumberOfTeamMembers() {
        System.out.println("Each team has n players in " + getName());
    }
}

    // Write your overridden getNumberOfTeamMembers method here
