This exercise is to test your understanding of Java Strings. A sample String declaration:  
String myString = "Hello World!"

The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.

Given two strings of lowercase English letters, A and B, perform the following operations:
Sum the lengths of A and B.
Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does B come before A in the dictionary?).
Capitalize the first letter in A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

Input Format:  
The first line contains a string A. The second line contains another string B. The strings are comprised of only lowercase English letters.

Output Format:  
There are three lines of output:
For the first line, sum the lengths of A and B.
For the second line, write Yes if A is lexicographically greater than B otherwise print No instead.
For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

Sample Input 0
hello

Sample Output 0
9
No

        /* Enter your code here. Print output to STDOUT. */
        int len = A.length() + B.length();
        String first = A.compareTo(B) > 0 ? "Yes" : "No";
        String newString = A.toUpperCase().charAt(0) + A.substring(1) + " " + B.toUpperCase().charAt(0)
                + B.substring(1);

        System.out.println(len);
        System.out.println(first);
        System.out.println(newString);
