# Kevin and Stuart want to play the 'The Minion Game'.

# Game Rules
# Both players are given the same string, S.
# Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string S.
# Stuart has to make words starting with consonants.
# Kevin has to make words starting with vowels.
# The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings.

# Scoring
# A player gets +1 point for each occurrence of the substring in the string S.

# For Example:
# String S = BANANA
# Kevin's vowel beginning word = ANA
# Here, ANA occurs twice in BANANA. Hence, Kevin will get 2 Points.
