# Given the names and grades for each student in a Physics class of N students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

# Note: If there are multiple students with the same grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

# Input Format:
# The first line contains an integer, N , the number of students.
# The 2N subsequent lines describe each student over 2 lines; the first line contains a student's name, and the second line contains their grade.
# There will always be one or more students having the second lowest grade.

# Output Format:
# Print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade in Physics; if there are multiple students, order their names alphabetically and print each one on a new line.

# Sample Input:
# 5
# Harry
# 37.21
# Berry
# 37.21
# Tina
# 37.2
# Akriti
# 41
# Harsh
# 39

# Sample Output:
# Berry
# Harry
