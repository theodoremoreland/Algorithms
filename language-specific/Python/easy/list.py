# Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:

# insert i e: Insert integer i at position e.
# print: Print the list.
# remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
# append e: Insert integer e at the end of the list.
# sort: Sort the list.
# pop: Pop the last element from the list.
# reverse: Reverse the list.

# Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands where each command will be of the 7 types listed above. Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.

# Input Format:
# The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of commands.
# Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains one of the commands described above.

# Constraints:
# The elements added to the list must be integers.

# Output Format:
# For each command of type print, print the list on a new line.

# Sample Input:
# 12
# insert 0 5
# insert 1 10
# insert 0 6
# print
# remove 6
# append 9
# append 1
# sort
# print
# pop
# reverse
# print

# Sample Output :
# [6, 5, 10]
# [1, 5, 9, 10]
# [9, 5, 1]
